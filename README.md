SQL Injection  Vulnerability Payload List

Overview

A SQL injection attack consists of insertion or "injection" of a SQL query
via the input data from the client to the application. A successful SQL injection exploit
can read sensitive data from the database, modify database data (Insert/Update/Delete), 
execute administration operations on the database (such as shutdown the DBMS), recover the content of a
given file present on the DBMS file system and in some cases issue commands to the operating system.
SQL injection attacks are a type of injection attack, in which SQL commands are injected into data-plane input in order 
to effect the execution of predefined SQL commands.
